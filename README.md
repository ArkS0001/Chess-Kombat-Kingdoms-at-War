### **Prompt for AI Web App Generator:**

**Title:** Create a Web App for "Chess-Combat: Kingdoms at War"

**Core Concept:**

Develop a feature-rich web application for a dynamic and strategic chess variant called "Chess-Combat: Kingdoms at War." This game transforms traditional chess into a fantasy wargame by incorporating elements of RPGs, collectible card games, and tabletop wargaming. The core gameplay should be intuitive for chess players but offer deep strategic layers through unique mechanics.

**Key Features to Implement:**

**1. Combat Resolution for Captures:**
*   Instead of standard piece replacement, captures trigger a "battle."
*   **Piece Health (HP):** Assign HP to each piece:
    *   Pawn: 1 HP
    *   Knight/Bishop: 2 HP
    *   Rook: 3 HP
    *   Queen: 4 HP
    *   King: Infinite HP (but the game is lost if checkmated).
*   **Dice Roll Combat:** When a piece initiates a capture, both the attacking and defending pieces roll a virtual six-sided die (d6).
*   **Combat Formula:** The outcome is determined by `(Attacker's Roll + Attacker's Piece Strength) vs. (Defender's Roll + Defender's Piece Strength)`.
    *   Piece Strength can be a base value (e.g., Pawn=1, Knight=3, etc.).
*   **Damage:** If the attacker's total is higher, the defender loses 1 HP. If the defender's total is equal to or higher, the attack is blocked, and no HP is lost.
*   **Piece Removal:** A piece is removed from the board only when its HP reaches 0.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Clearly display piece HP and animate the dice roll and battle outcome.

**2. RPG Elements for Piece Progression:**
*   **Experience Points (XP):** Pieces gain XP for participating in and winning battles. For example, +1 XP for a successful capture (removing a piece).
*   **Leveling Up:** When a piece accumulates a certain amount of XP (e.g., 3 XP), it "levels up."
*   **Upgrades:** Upon leveling up, the player can choose an upgrade for that piece from a predefined skill tree. Examples include:
    *   A Pawn could gain the ability to move one square diagonally (like a Ferz).
    *   A Knight could gain the ability to also move one square orthogonally (like a Wazir).
    *   A Bishop could gain a "ranged shot" that doesn't require it to move.
*   **Visual Indicators:** Clearly show the level and upgrades of each piece.

**3. Cards for Special Abilities and Chaos:**
*   **Deck System:** Each player has a customizable deck of "Battle Cards."
*   **Hand and Mana:** Players start with a hand of 5 cards and gain "mana" each turn to play them.
*   **Card Examples:**
    *   **Fireball:** (Cost: 3 Mana) - Deals 1 damage to all pieces in a 2x2 area.
    *   **Shield:** (Cost: 2 Mana) - Negates the next attack on a friendly piece.
    *   **Teleport:** (Cost: 4 Mana) - Move a friendly piece to any empty square on your half of the board.
*   **Deck Building:** Allow players to build their own decks from a collection of available cards.
*   **Card Play Interface:** Integrate a sleek UI for drawing, viewing, and playing cards.

**4. Expanded Board with Terrain and Wargame Tactics:**
*   **Board Size:** Offer multiple board sizes, including the standard 8x8 and a larger 10x10.
*   **Terrain Tiles:** Randomly generate or allow players to choose maps with special terrain tiles:
    *   **Forests:** Pieces on these tiles can only be attacked by adjacent pieces (blocking ranged attacks).
    *   **Hills:** Ranged units (see below) on hills gain +1 to their attack rolls.
    *   **Rivers:** Pawns cannot cross rivers; other pieces must spend a full turn to cross.
*   **Fog of War (Optional Mode):** An advanced mode where enemy pieces are hidden unless they are within the line of sight of one of your pieces.

**5. New Unit Types:**

*   **Ranged/Artillery Units:**
    *   **Archer:** Moves one square in any direction. Captures like a Queen but cannot capture adjacent pieces. Replaces one of the starting Knights.
    *   **Catapult:** Moves like a Rook. Captures by jumping over one piece (friend or foe) to land on and destroy the piece directly behind it in a straight line. Replaces the other starting Knight.

*   **Hybrid Commanders:**
    *   **Gryphon:** Combines the moves of a Bishop and a Knight. Replaces the Queen. This powerful piece should have higher HP and strength but also be a high-value target.

*   **Special Ops/Disruptor Units:**
    *   **Assassin:** Replaces a starting Pawn. The Assassin can move two squares in any direction but cannot capture. Instead, if it moves adjacent to an enemy piece (except the King), that piece loses 1 HP. The Assassin is removed from the board after using this ability three times.

*   **Animal/Mythical Troops:**
    *   **Centaur:** (Replaces a Bishop) Moves like a standard Bishop but can also make a single Knight's move once per game (a "charge").

**User Interface and Experience (UI/UX):**

*   **Clear and Intuitive Design:** The board, pieces, HP, XP, and card interface must be easy to understand at a glance.
*   **Animations and Effects:** Create engaging animations for battles, spell effects, and piece movements.
*   **Game Modes:** Include a "Classic Mode" (standard chess), the full "Chess-Combat: Kingdoms at War" mode, and customizable modes where players can toggle specific features on or off.
*   **Multiplayer and AI:** Support online multiplayer with matchmaking, as well as a single-player mode against a scalable AI opponent.

**Final Deliverable:**

A fully functional web application playable in a modern web browser, featuring all the specified game mechanics, a clean user interface, and both single-player and multiplayer capabilities. The app should be designed to be expandable with new units, cards, and terrain types in the future.
